name: Codacy Variation Fallback

# This workflow injects a success check on 'Codacy Coverage Variation' when the check is not reported by Codacy,
# so it can avoid bloking auto-merging on Pull Requests that has a check success requirement on it.

# Examples where 'Codacy Coverage Variation' is not reported by Codacy:
# - Modification on just a test class, and your test classes are ignored at 'codacy.yml'.
# - Modification of 'README.md', which has no coverage.
# - Modification of a GitHub Action workflow, which has no coverage.

# In those cases, this workflow will bypass the 'Codacy Coverage Variation' check, allowing the PR to auto-merge.
